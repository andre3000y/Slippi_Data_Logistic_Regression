# Slippi Data with Logistic Regression
Attempting to create a model that uses logistic regression to predict the winner of a game of Super Smash Brothers Melee using data from only the first n stocks, where n is variable (here, I use 3 stocks). Data was taken using the [Slippi](https://slippi.gg/) software, which records game data in the `.slp` format.

## Disclaimer
In short, credit for the data collection and parsing software for this project goes entirely to the creators of Slippi.

I am only an intermediate programmer in the Python language. The best (most complete/easiest to use) libraries for use with `.slp` files are in JavaScript. As a result, I had to pull sample code from [this repository](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-js) in order to complete this project. I simply learned just enough JavaScript in order to loop a portion of this code over a set of 220 games in the `.slp` format (in the `Slippi` folder of this repository), saving the statistics generated by Slippi-js into `.txt` files in the `json` format into the `jsons` folder of this repository.
## Results
Using a small dataset of only 220 games (prior to cleaning), the model was able to produce the following ROC curves from a 4-fold cross validation:

The average accuracy accross the 4 splits was 75%.
